const newHighlightTask= `
this file works.
please preserve comments and jsdoc. you can add to them though.
for a highligher change to creating a div and appending it to body, then reusing it to indicate the highlighted element. dispose of it when menu is closed.
position the new highlighter div using getBoundingClientRect of the element to be highlighted.
make the highlighter motion animated with ease-in-out css transition.
the hightlight will have a dotted border of 2px and a semi-transparent background color.
the border color will be a hue-rotation. slowly changing color.

const highlightFixTask= `
this file works.
change the style of the hightlight to a dotted border of 2px and a semi-transparent black background
 color.
the border color will be a hue-rotation. slowly changing color.
the highlighted element will have its contrast increased.
